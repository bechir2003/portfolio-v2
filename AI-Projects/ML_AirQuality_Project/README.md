# Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting respiratory health impacts based on air quality indicators. The primary goal is to predict the **RespiratoryCases** using environmental factors like AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and other related pollutants. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes environmental factors such as air quality indices (AQI), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), and other pollutants.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on common regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, missing value imputation, and feature scaling are performed to ensure optimal model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
  - `scipy`: Statistical tests.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and model training.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `RecordID`: Unique identifier for each record.
- `AQI`: Air Quality Index, an aggregate measure of air pollution.
- `PM10`: Concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller.
- `PM2.5`: Concentration of fine particulate matter (2.5 micrometers or smaller).
- `NO2`: Nitrogen dioxide levels.
- `SO2`: Sulfur dioxide levels.
- `O3`: Ozone levels.
- `Temperature`: Air temperature (in °C).
- `Humidity`: Air humidity (in %).
- `WindSpeed`: Wind speed (in km/h).
- `CardiovascularCases`: Number of cardiovascular health cases.
- `HospitalAdmissions`: Number of hospital admissions related to respiratory health.
- `HealthImpactScore`: A calculated score based on health impact.
- `HealthImpactClass`: Categorical class based on health severity.
